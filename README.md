# 🔍 Findora – AI-Powered Lost & Found Platform

Findora is a full-stack AI-powered lost and found platform that uses
computer vision and intelligent similarity matching to connect lost items
with found items efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Image-based item reporting
- 🤖 CNN-based AI matching engine
- 📍 Location-aware item search
- 💰 Optional reward support
- 🎯 High-confidence match detection (≥80%)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python (FastAPI)
- SQLite
- TensorFlow (CNN-based vision encoder)
- Computer Vision (image embeddings & similarity matching)

### Frontend
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons

---

## 🧠 AI / ML Overview

- A CNN-based vision encoder extracts feature embeddings from item images
- Text descriptions and metadata are combined with image similarity
- A similarity scoring engine identifies potential matches
- Matches with confidence ≥80% are flagged as high-confidence results

> Note: The trained model file (vision_encoder.h5) is generated locally and is
not included in this repository.

## 🔁 How It Works

1. Users report lost or found items with images and descriptions
2. AI extracts visual features using a CNN-based encoder
3. Similarity scores are computed across items
4. High-confidence matches are identified automatically
5. Users can view matches with confidence visualization
